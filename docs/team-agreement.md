## Team Communication

- Respond to Slack or Text within 24 hours (have notifications on!)
- Communicate respectfully with one another
- Minimal memes (must be something you’d show to Madooei) in Team 10 slack

## Team Meetings

- Set meetings no later than three days in advance.
- Document each meeting to list progress and decisions and put into the slack team chat
- Skipping a meeting without 24 hours notice, with the exclusion of emergencies, shall be punished with purchasing a pizza of the team’s discretion, min of $25, max of $50.
- On each following offense the minimum and maximum will increase by $15
- Skipping 2 meetings without proper notice means you must write a note of apology to Madooei and read it out loud to him with the members present (optional for the non-offending members). Also, talking with team advisors to make plans for not missing more meetings.
- Skipping 3 meetings will lead to contemplation of expulsion from the team and an apology reading to the class in the middle of class with Madooei’s permission
- Team Meeting Saturday from 6PM - 9PM or 1PM-4PM

## Time Commitment

- 3 hours of meeting time per week
- Minimum 3 hours of independent work per week.
- If a team member feels as if their time commitment does not follow the aforementioned time expectations (too little or too much), then they should voice their concerns on the Slack channel (either rethinking the scope of the iteration or ask for help). 
- Remember this is a (really good, Madooei taught) 3-credit class.

## Features

- Features should be assigned in pairs.
- At meetings, features will be assigned to different group pairs.
- Feature pairs are expected to fully test and document their features.
- Do not push tests that fail to main
- There is a three day maximum to communicate a change of expectations on a feature’s implementation after the start of sprint.
- When implementing a feature at the start of a sprint, mention the user stories that will be addressed by the feature (and any dependencies that this user story has on other user stories).
- When working on concurrent features in an iteration, feature pairs must create a plan for how features will communicate with each other (For example, expected inputs and outputs, format of data, etc.).
- A feature is done when the user story is fully realized with no bugs and a proper presentation of capabilities in the following meeting. Full documentation should be provided.
- After a day of work, the pair should report what has been done into the Slack channel.

## Git Shenanigans

- When doing independent work send a message on Slack that you are starting independent work and clock out when done.
- Work on your own branch 
- For merge conflicts, it is the responsibility of the person who got the conflict to resolve the error
- Also, make sure the tests for all other features still pass after merge.
- DO NOT REMOVE TESTS WITHOUT PROPER DOCUMENTATION OF EDGE CASE
- If having excessive merge issues working members can contact members who last successfully pushed to help with merging issues.
- Pull at the start of any working session and push to your feature branch at the end of any working session
- When you push, check the github repository for what was actually pushed and verify that the push went through. Update in Slack. 
- DO NOT "--force" or "--f" EVER
- Pizza-able offence

## Values

- Each team member is expected to come to meetings on time and prepared.
- We will hold each other accountable when someone does not act in accordance with this agreement.
- Communicate any problems.
