# Project Roadmap

## Iteration 1

**Dates:** ()\
**Goal:** Establish a centralized system for managing students, machines, budget codes, and transactions while ensuring machine access is restricted to trained and authorized users.

### Must-Have Features:

1. As an administrator, I would like there to be a central dashboard that serves as a center of operations on students, machines, budget codes, and transactions.
2. As an administrator, I would like to be able to add and ban/remove specific users from using machines if they are not using the machines correctly.
3. As an administrator, I want the ability to add and ban/remove specific budget codes so that clubs that do not pay cannot use the machines.
4. As a user, I want to scan my card to turn on the machine so that I can use the machine for my projects.
5. As an administrator, I would like the card scanners to restrict access based on a student's current trainings to ensure that the machines would only activate for students that are trained on the machine.
6. As an administrator, I would like to have a password and the ability to reset my password to prevent non-admins from using the administrator dashboard.
   
### Nice-to-Have Features:

## Iteration 2

**Dates:** ()\
**Goal:** Implement financial tracking and reporting to enable accurate billing and financial transparency for administrators and organization leaders.

### Must-Have Features:

1. As an administrator, I want user's time to be tracked, so that I know how much to bill them.
2. As an administrator, I would like financial statements to be sent on a day of my choosing every month that summarizes the details of transactions that occur every month. A transaction includes the student/staff that used the machine, the budget code associated with the machining operation, the machine used, and the time spent.

3. As a student, I would like to be able to select my budget code for the club/class I am doing work for.
4. As an administrator, I would like to add budget codes to student accounts so that they can be associated with an account that can be billed.

### Nice-to-Have Features:

1. As an administrator, I would like for the financial statement to be automated for ease of use.
2. As an organization leader, I would like to receive the monthly usage bill of my organization in the machine shop to help track my orgâ€™s spending in the shop.

## Iteration 3

**Dates:** ()\
**Goal:** Enhance authentication and access control, ensuring administrators can enforce restrictions on users, clubs, and machines.

### Must-Have Features:

1. As an administrator, I would like to be able to activate/deactivate certain machines (the Gatekeepers would not allow anyone to activate these machines) in case the machines are out of order.

### Nice-to-Have Features:

1. As an administrator, I want certain budget codes to automatically expire so people do not have access beyond the time allotted.
2. As a student, I would like to optionally sign in with my JHU credentials so that I can sign in without my physical card.
3. As an administrator, I would like to be able to sign people up with only their JHU credentials.
4. As an administrator, I want the ability to time out specific users for a specified amount of time so that it can be used for rule enforcement.
5. As an administrator, I want the ability to time out specific clubs for a specified amount of time so that it can be used for rule enforcement.

## Iteration 4

**Dates:** ()\
**Goal:** Improve usability and maintenance tracking, ensuring students can access real-time shop availability and report issues, while maintaining administrator security controls.

### Must-Have Features:

(None)

### Nice-to-Have Features:

1. As a student, I would like to see how busy the machine shop is online so that I can see if the machines I want are available.
2. As an administrator, I want student accounts to be automatically flagged when their expected graduation year passes so I know to remove them.
3. As a student, I would like to report any maintenance issues in the shop or of the machines so that administrators are aware of issues happening in the shop.
4. As a machine owner, I want the software to have safeguards against turning off the machine mid-use, as otherwise sudden shut-offs will damage the machine.
